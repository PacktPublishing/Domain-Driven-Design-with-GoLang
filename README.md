## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
=== RUN Test_Point
value_objects_test.go:13: a and b were not equal
--- FAIL: Test_Point (0.00s)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for intermediate-level Go developers who are looking to ensure that they not only write maintainable code, but also deliver great business value. If you have a basic understanding of Go and are interested in learning about Domain-driven design, or you’ve explored Domain-driven design before but never in the context of Go, then this book will be helpful.
